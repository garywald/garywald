ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @garywald

ðŸ‘€ Do you like Devops ? I love the way to combine development and SRE to improve the speed and the facility of coding.
In a way, I feel like I can do a project from start to the end with a great package of good practices. 
Who can denied me the fact to feel proud after a project which can be deployed, tested, upgraded, monitored, with alerting and without regression.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm looking for devops arround frontend packaging

ðŸ“– Iâ€™m learning how to develop on React to skill up arround the frontend development
